# The Well-Architected Training for partners

This repository contains the public training materials for the Well-Architected Framework Training for partners.

The [Well-Architected Framework][WAF-Intro] is a well-defined process for running architecture reviews and provide your customers a consistent list of recommendations for enhancing their workloads in Azure.

These materials can be used standalone, but they are intended to be used in a training run by the GPS team in Microsoft. Ask your Microsoft representative if there is any Well-Architected event in your region that you would like to attend.

## [Well-Architected Workshop][WAF-Workshop]

This is a 2-hour presentation usually delivered by a Cloud Solution Architect to a group of architects or pre-sales engineers. It explains what is the Well-Architected Framework, why it is useful, how is the process of a Well-Architected assessment and goes deep into the 5 pillars of Well-Architected.

You will get a deep explanation about what are the most important questions to ask and what tools you can use to gather all the data you need.

## [Well-Architected Lab][WAF-Lab]

After having attended a [WAF Workshop][WAF-Workshop], the next step is to attend this event where you will get hands-on experience with the Well-Architected Framework.
It is a 1-day lab, where you will be given a customer case and you will do a group exercise to run the Well-Architected process, and create the reports and planning documents to present to the customers with a selection of recommendations that you will have to prioritize.

Ask your local PTS/PDM in Microsoft GPS organization for getting info about upcoming workshops.
